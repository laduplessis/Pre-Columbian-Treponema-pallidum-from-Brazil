## Abstract
_The origins of treponemal diseases have long remained enigmatic, especially considering the sudden onset of the first syphilis epidemic in late 15th century Europe, and its hypothesised arrival from the Americas with Columbus’ expeditions. Recently, ancient DNA evidence has revealed various treponemal infections circulating in early modern Europe and colonial-era Mexico3–6. However, no genetic evidence of any treponematosis has been recovered from either the Americas or the Old World that can be reliably dated prior to the first transatlantic contact. Here, we present the first-ever treponemal genomes from nearly 2,000-year-old human remains from Brazil. We reconstruct four ancient genomes of a prehistoric treponemal pathogen, most closely related to the bejel-causing agent, Treponema pallidum ssp. endemicum. Contradicting bejel’s modern-day geographical niche in the arid regions of the world, the results call to question the prior paleopathological characterisation of treponeme subspecies and showcase their adaptive potential. A high-coverage genome is used to improve molecular clock dating estimations, placing the divergence of all modern T. pallidum subspecies firmly in pre-Columbian times. Overall, our study demonstrates the archaeogenetic opportunities to uncover key events in pathogen evolution and emergence, paving the way to unprecedented hypotheses on the spread of treponematoses across time._
